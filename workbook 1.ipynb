During the time most sociologists and social scientists were using science to justify racism. Du Bois argued against these racist assumptions and show the importance of history to understand social inequalities.\n",

    "* American sociology excluded Du Bois' scholarship. Due to efforts of many activists and scholars, Du Bois is being more recognized as a important sociologist.\n",

Most of the work comes from his The Georgia Negro: A Social Study. In the Battle-Baptiste and Rusert book, they also show data visuals from additional work from Du Bois. \n",

    "Du Bois is creative in creating the figures. He uses color, spirals, and maps. An interesting pattern Du Bois does is spiral or curves bars when they are too high. A lot of his figures are comparing across time or across gender to show difference. Showing difference is central to quantitative methods. In sociology, we argue those difference stem from systems or structures.\n",
